# Snake

React Native Snake Game (WIP)

## Idea

- Use Views with different background colors to with size 100% / items per column to have a grid with snakes and food
- Use PanResonder on outer View to detect swipes in the four directions and change the snakes direction
- Use react-timer-mixin, setTimeout and requestAnimation for movement of snake and use transition to make it look smooth
